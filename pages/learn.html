                            I don’t wanna give away any spoilers on how the resourceful teens in our story 
                            save Tucson from a dystopian future. But there are things we can do to prevent 
                            it from getting that bad in the first place - practical actions we can take right 
                            now to make sure that our children and their children have what they need to 
                            thrive in the future.

                            Of course, one of the biggest issues of living in our desert town is lack of 
                            water. We are in the midst of a 20 year drought. Currently, Tucson relies mostly 
                            on Colorado River water. That water is pumped 326 miles uphill to reach us. 
                            Unfortunately, that water has been depleted due to drought and climate change. 
                            On top of that, we share it with seven other thirsty states and Mexico. 
                            And some of those states have first dibs!

                            How do we make sure we have enough water in the future? That’s a complicated 
                            question. Obviously, we need to conserve water anyway we can. But there is an 
                            exciting solution right under our roof tops. According to Brad Landcaster, there 
                            is enough water for every Tucsonan’s needs if everyone did

                            Gutters can direct stormwater from rooftops (and other surfaces) to cisterns 
                            (water barrels) and catchment basins to irrigate desert landscaping, food gardens 
                            and low-water fruit trees.

                            Trees! I love trees! Trees can really cool down your home and neighborhood. And 
                            they also sequester carbon. The Mayor has a

                            There are several options for affordable trees, including:
                            <ul>

                            But since it is the desert, you need to be mindful of the water you use. Native 
                            desert trees like mesquite and palo verde don’t take a lot of water once they are 
                            established. Plant them by catchment basins. These basins, filled with wood chip 
                            mulch and native grass create a sponge to hold the water longer!

                            One of the hottest trends in climate solutions is regenerative agriculture (and 
                            gardening). Why not replace your water-wasting lawn with a food garden?

                            gardening</a> is one of the best ways to sequester carbon and it doesn’t require 
                            pesticides. Composting also keeps food waste out of the methane-leaking landfills!
