                    <section class="journey-section">
                        <p class="journey-text">
                            It all started on a sunny fall day. The morning my husband Dan peddled off to 
                            enjoy Watershed Management Group’s Homescape Harvest Tour, in his hand a map of 
                            some yards that the co-op had worked on through the years. When Dan got home, all 
                            sweaty and excited, he rushed me out the door to see some inspiring examples of 
                            rainwater harvesting. I was especially blown away by WMG’s living lab where 
                            everything on the property, including some fruit trees, were irrigated with 
                            rainwater. They weren’t using any city water! What a great way to conserve water! 
                            Docents explained how there was enough stormwater to fill every Tucsonan’s needs 
                            if we all “planted the rain.” Finally, a practical solution to making Tucson
                            water secure!
                        </p>
                        <p class="journey-text">
                            That tour changed our lives! Dan and I learned everything we could about rainwater 
                            harvesting. He became a member of their co-op, spending every free weekend digging 
                            catchment basins in people's yards and installing water barrels to collect runoff 
                            from rooftops to irrigate native plants. We've spent the last seven years sharing 
                            what we learned. I <a href="https://www.sustainablelivingtucson.com/">blogged</a> 
                            about our adventures (and misadventures) in transitioning to a more sustainable 
                            lifestyle. But at some point we realized that we were just preaching to the choir. 
                            We needed to reach beyond our little bubble of influence on facebook.

                            I wrote the play <span class="artwork-title">ReGeneration: The Tucson Story</span>
                            to reach out to more Tucsonans. It is about a diverse group of teens who bring 
                            their communities together to make Tucson habitable as the climate disaster 
                            progresses.
                        </p>
                        <p class="journey-text">
                            While writing this play, I was able to use the knowledge about sustainability 
                            that I had gathered over the years. The REAL challenge was writing about the 
                            other cultures that weren't mine. I did a lot of research on the Tohono O’odham 
                            and LatinX lifestyles. I wanted to make sure I was respectful of those 
                            traditions. A member of the O'odham generously took the time to read it and give 
                            me feedback. He said he enjoyed it. He only had a problem with one section. He 
                            said, "They would never do that." So I promptly removed it. I was still a little 
                            uneasy about the street kids’ dialogue. I wanted to make sure it was authentic. 
                            A high school English teacher agreed to have her students read it – when they 
                            got back from Spring Break. Then COVID struck.
                        </p>
                        <p class="journey-text">
                            I continued to rewrite the script and get feedback. I was painfully aware that 
                            while the pandemic may have stalled my production, it certainly had not slowed 
                            down climate change. I decided that it was time to contact local high schools 
                            and theater companies about producing the play. But they had problems of their 
                            own. They were struggling to adapt to the challenges of social distancing. 
                            Teachers were learning to conduct virtual classes. The theaters were working on 
                            ways to stay relevant. There was no time to read a play from an unknown 
                            playwright. However, in the problem was the solution. Theater teachers and 
                            theater companies started producing virtual (Zoom) plays. That was it! Inspired 
                            by their productions, I decided to produce a virtual reading of my play.

                            It was time for a leap of faith. I started my search for my diverse cast. I began 
                            by asking that high school English teacher to recommend students. A friend 
                            introduced me to a drama teacher. She announced it to her class. I finally got two 
                            responses. One of them was a bright young actress, Itzel, who I later cast. She 
                            convinced a couple of her friends, Ariel and Andrew, from the drama club to 
                            audition. They were great! I cast them all.  That gave me the confidence to 
                            broaden my casting call.
                        </p>
                        <p class="journey-text">
                            I knew I would need two Latino teens to play the brothers. I had no idea that they 
                            would be so hard to find! I asked everyone I knew in the theater and film community 
                            for recommendations. Used all my contacts. Nothing but dead ends! Then I spotted a 
                            PSA with a young man who looked right for the part of Rogelio. I tracked Eduardo 
                            down on Facebook and asked him if he would be interested in being in my play. I 
                            waited with anticipation as he read the script. He got back to me after a few days. 
                            Said he was fascinated with the sustainability aspects of the play, but it was the 
                            characters' relationships that kept him turning the pages! He was definitely 
                            interested in the part. Only...one thing...he was a Pima College graduate. I had 
                            to convince him that I was confident that he could play a teen.

                            As difficult as it was finding a young Latino actor, I knew I had a bigger 
                            challenge ahead - finding a Tohono O’odham actress to play Ha:san. Then it 
                            happened...a little miracle...I discovered a short video by a young Tohono O’odham 
                            woman. It turned out to be a young woman I had met at a special Loft Cinema 
                            screening of <span class="artwork-title">Warrior Women</span>. We reconnected 
                            on Facebook. I asked her if she would be interested in being in my play. I was 
                            thrilled when she answered, “Yes!” I considered that a sign! With two of the most 
                            difficult roles cast, I trudged forward to cast all 16 roles! A big thanks to our 
                            theater and film community who sent out casting notices. While most of the actors 
                            reside in Tucson, Zoom has allowed me to cast people from other places, as well - 
                            like New Jersey, Texas, California, and Phoenix.

                            I am blessed with a talented and hardworking cast – particularly the teens who not 
                            only excel at acting, but who are also instrumental in getting this production off 
                            the ground. They are my assistant director, stage manager, promoters, technical 
                            support, and artists!

                            We hold all of the rehearsals and production meetings online. There are certainly 
                            challenges with using a virtual medium and a steep learning curve for me. But it 
                            is fun to work with this creative group of young people to find solutions. The 
                            teens are masters of coming up with blocking and using props in the limited space. 
                            Even separated in their individual Zoom frames you can see the comradery.  It’s a 
                            blast to watch them! They are also my advisers. When I was struggling with finding 
                            the balance between using authentic street dialogue and being culturally 
                            respectful, they shared valuable insights.  They are teaching me how to be a 
                            better director and communicator. And they are learning too. Throughout the 
                            rehearsal process, the teens are discovering sustainability practices like 
                            rainwater harvesting and regenerative gardening. Some will act as ambassadors to 
                            share that knowledge.

                            The cool thing is that this play is about a diverse group of young people who 
                            bring their communities together to save Tucson – presented by a diverse group of 
                            young people inspired to share solutions to create a sustainable future for 
                            Tucson. I couldn't be prouder!
