                                Ariel Cheng is currently an undergraduate student at the University of Arizona. 
                                Cheng has acted in many various plays during her high school career and still 
                                continues to act in other productions in the local Tucson, Arizona area. Many of 
                                the productions she acted in includes 
                                <span class="artwork-title">Done to Death</span>, 
                                <span class="artwork-title">Much Ado About Nothing</span>, and 
                                <span class="artwork-title">Curing Greed</span>. Other projects she has acted in 
                                includes student films. Ariel Cheng has joined the 
                                <span class="artwork-title">Regeneration</span> production as a stage manager, 
                                the narrator, and understudy for all female actors. She joined this due to her 
                                interest in becoming more environmentally friendly. This project/play promotes 
                                the ideas that Ariel Cheng hopes to share with others in hopes of combating the 
                                drastic climate changes.

                                    My name is Tierra Rose Domingo. I am 21 years old and live in Arizona on the 
                                    Tohono O'odham Nation reservation in the village of Pisinemo. I really enjoy 
                                    singing, when I am at work by myself I sing all day everyday it's my favorite 
                                    pastime. I also love listening to podcasts, I feel like I learn something new 
                                    every day. When Jana asked me to be in her play I was so thrilled, I will do 
                                    my best job at acting to make her proud! This is actually my first time being 
                                    in an actual play and I am very nervous but excited! I have already learned so 
                                    much from Jana just from a few rehearsals we've had and I can gladly say I get 
                                    a little better each time. I believe that this play will be a great way to open 
                                    our eyes to the horrible things global warming will lead to in the future but 
                                    also possibly give a little push to the ones that can do a little something 
                                    with their actions and voices!

                                Eduardo Rodriguez is a graduate from Pima Community College, receiving his AFA in 
                                Performing Arts. He has performed all around Tucson and out, while receiving 
                                multiple awards in theatre. He is thrilled to be a part of an awesome group and 
                                excited to be working digitally. Eduardo took interest in 
                                <span class="artwork-title">ReGeneration</span> for its meaning, how its words 
                                brought awareness to our environment. A likely possible path to not only Tucson's 
                                future, but for everywhere else if no actions are taken. The relationships between 
                                <span class="artwork-title">ReGeneration</span>'s characters brought him forward 
                                to the script as he loved the interactions between them, how they bring 
                                togetherness and passion to create a better outcome for the next generation and so 
                                on. Lastly, he thanks his family and friends for supporting him. Much Love.

                                    UA Graduate with degrees in International Journalism, Film and Television. My 
                                    interest peaks when we speak on environmental mindfulness. It is easy to be aloof 
                                    and enjoy the amenities technology grants us and not ponder on the cataclysmic 
                                    decay our world is enduring. After I read the script for 
                                    <span class="artwork-title">ReGeneration</span>, I was given a peep into what 
                                    Tucson may look like in a not-so-distant future due to climate change. I have 
                                    grown up in a world with less green than my parents and my descendants will 
                                    most likely live under the same conditions Hasan and Rogelio are living in the 
                                    story. I hope people become mindful and choose to at least try to change their 
                                    lifestyle to a more renewable one. This play shows us that one doesn’t have to 
                                    come up with a whole new way to fix things, our ancestors may as well have 
                                    already had the blueprints to the answers.

                                    I've been acting in both theatre and film for many years. I also like to write 
                                    and produce my own work. I really love to study acting. Sometimes I love my 
                                    classes more than I love being cast in a project. I am passionate about history, 
                                    anthropology, reading books on a variety of topics and environmental issues. I'm

                                    and Nature Conservancy. I love the character of the Crazy Week Lady. She is a 
                                    big-hearted woman who lives by her values and doesn't care if that gets in the 
                                    way of what others think of her. I have enjoyed being a small part of such a 
                                    young, diverse and talented cast. The script is great and covers such needed 
                                    topics. To me the natural world is so inspiring and re-generating for my body 
                                    and spirit.

                                <q>
                                    My name's Dean Friskey, I’ve been acting for about 6 years now. I’ve competed 
                                    and won at State for Sound Design, been in 14+ shows and just love the theatre 
                                    community and what it brings out in young and older adults. My biggest passions 
                                    are theatre and psychology, I feel as if they work hand and hand with each 
                                    other especially on stage. I’m a very simplistic guy, I like to hit the gym 
                                    every afternoon, spend time with good friends, and work my butt off to make 
                                    some money. I mainly wanted to be in this production because I saw it as a 
                                    huge opportunity, and also because my best best friend is the whole reason I’m 
                                    in theatre and have such a passion for it. We always talked about doing a 
                                    professional show and making it big, he passed away my senior year and never 
                                    got the opportunity; so this one’s for him. I’m hoping to just get more 
                                    experience from doing this show and learn more from other actors, and to put 
                                    on an awesome production. Why do I care? Why not care? Everyone, especially 
                                    younger kids of this generation should understand the importance of what we’re 
                                    doing to this earth. Our generation is responsible for taking care of the 
                                    future, so us and everyone should know how to prevent problems from occurring 
                                    so we don’t hit a dystopian future for our ecosystem. I think this production 
                                    is a perfect way to spread the word and get people to listen.

                                    Hello! I'm Itzel Macias. I've been into theater all throughout high school and 
                                    used to be in small plays when I was a child. I love theater, dance, biking 
                                    and do volunteer work in my free time. I've been doing volunteer work with an 
                                    organization named Living Streets Alliance for around 6 years-they revolve 
                                    around making streets a safe and accessible environment for everyone. As well 
                                    as being a part of a good amount of protests for a variety of social justice 
                                    issues and am part of the human rights club in my school. All the information 
                                    I had about this production was that it involved water harvesting and being 
                                    environmentally conscious-which caught my interest since I do love the idea 
                                    of not killing the planet. As I learned more about this production, I wanted 
                                    to be a part of it to learn as well as be part of a depiction of what the 
                                    ideal future could be.

                                Bella Cucchetti is 14 years old, and a freshman at Xavier College Prep in Phoenix,
                                AZ. She has been in over 14 shows and has been acting since she was 9 in local 
                                community theatre. She has done several plays, and even a radio play this fall, but 
                                her favorite means of expression is through musicals. She is involved in her 
                                school's Drama Club and enjoys working with young children. She volunteers every 
                                summer as a counselor at her church summer camp and even started an Improv group 
                                called Bella's Tales to share her passion for improv/acting. She also loves creative 
                                writing, playing piano, painting/drawing, singing, dancing and all types of music!

                                This production has really taught Bella the importance of sustainability and 
                                preserving our environment. She has been working hard on some art to help spread the 
                                word about this incredible production and hopes that it inspires others to think 
                                about their environment and take a part in making this world a better place! 
                                Thanks, Jana Segal for this opportunity to share in your dream.

                                Anne Dalton transitioned from being a freelance photojournalist to filmmaker when 
                                she produced the film, <span class="artwork-title">The Price of Silence</span>, 
                                about domestic minor sex trafficking, in 2011. It raised awareness of this national 
                                problem. She went on to produce other short docs focusing on community life in 
                                Tucson with an emphasis on art and health, including the award-winning
                                <span class="artwork-title">Puppies & Poses</span>. In 2015, she established the 
                                IFA Production CoLab to provide training and hands-on experience for beginners in 
                                film production. She currently works as a free-lance director and serves on the 
                                board of Independent Film Arizona. Her most recent production, 
                                <span class="artwork-title">Feeding our Souls</span>, will premiere at the Tucson 
                                Jewish Film Festival in January, 2021. In 2019, she began film acting and has 
                                appeared in five films to date.

                            <p>
                                When Jana reached out to the Sky Island art teacher, Amy Wood, about the 
                                possibility of her art students contributing their skills to the production, 
                                she understood that it was a long shot - especially with all the challenges 
                                of teaching a class on Zoom. Sensing an engaging project for her students, 
                                Ms. Woods arranged for Jana to present her idea to her Visual Art and 
                                Art/Design students. The students listened intently as Jana shared with the 
                                class the reason she decided to do the play. How she had observed that there 
                                wasn't as much rain as when her boys were little and how she had become 
                                concerned about the water crisis we were leaving for them. In her pursuit for 
                                a sustainable solution, she found out that there was enough water for everyone 
                                in Tucson if everyone harvested the rain. The only problem was that hardly 
                                anyone knew about it. So she wrote this play to reach out to the young people 
                                who would be most affected. She explained that she needed the students expertise 
                                and talent to make this project more compelling to teens. Together, they went 
                                through the list of set descriptions needed for each scene: a desert scene, 
                                a dilapidated house in the wash, a community garden, an ambulance outside of a 
                                house in the barrio, an oasis in the desert... They selected the projects that 
                                spoke to them and are diligently working to get them completed before the 
                                virtual premiere.

                            <p>
                                R3D was born and raised in Tucson, Arizona. He has been involved in music 
                                since the age of eight and began writing at the age of 12. He started 
                                rapping because he wanted to be heard. No one listened when he spoke but 
                                when music got involved everybody listened. He came from a neighborhood 
                                in South Tucson where you’re either a gang member or sheltered at home 
                                for protection. And he didn’t want either, so he became an artist. 
                                Writing music kept him away from what most of his peers were doing. It 
                                kept him busy so he had no time to be out getting in trouble. It also 
                                freed him from many problems growing up. Became a kind of therapy so when 
                                he had problems he didn’t speak to a person, he spoke to a mic. Eventually 
                                people heard, and he gained the respect of the people in his neighborhood.

                                    My journey hasn't exactly taken me where I expected when I completed my MFA in 
                                    Dramatic Writing. After working on several love projects like co-writing the 
                                    award-winning short, <span class="artwork-title">Model-T Biscuits</span> with 
                                    my mom (Lorna Beall) and raising my two boys, I spent years building Tucson's 
                                    independent film community and writing movie reviews to promote filmmakers 
                                    who produced meaningful films. In the process, I inadvertently watched a few 
                                    environmental docs which led to the most important trek of my journey - 
                                    embracing a sustainable desert lifestyle with my husband, Dan. Inspired by a 
                                    scruffy gang of rainwater harvesting enthusiasts, we started spending our 
                                    weekends digging basins to capture the rain. (You can read about our 
                                    adventures and mis-adventures at 
                                    <a href="http://www.sustainablelivingtucson.com/">Sustainable Living Tucson</a>.)
                                    We spent the last seven years learning everything we could about sustainability 
                                    and climate solutions and sharing that passion. It was exhausting!

                                    After searching my heart, I've finally decided that the best way to reach people is 
                                    through storytelling. I love telling environmental stories like "The Beaver 
                                    Family" and "The Santa Cruz River Story" and using my filmmaking skills to 
                                    make videos like

                                    It is such a joy to get back to my first love of playwriting. I am so blessed to 
                                    be working with the talented cast and crew of ReGeneration: The Tucson Story. 
                                    I truly believe that we can all use our talents and passions to create a 
                                    sustainable future for our children and generations to come.
